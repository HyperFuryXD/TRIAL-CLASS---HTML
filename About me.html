         Hi! My name is Viraj and I'm a 13 year old boy who lives in Singapore.
         I have lots of hobbies, some of them being video games,reading,playing sports etc.
         I'm in 7th grade.
         I have accomplished a lot academically and excel at public speaking and debating. I'm not afraid to talk to others and in fact, i enjoy it!
         I do not like to think about what others think about me as I like to live life by my rules!
