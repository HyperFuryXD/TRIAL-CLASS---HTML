    Recently, I made a survey for schoolchilden to fill about the second languages in their school.
    I have done a speech at school and a presentation on the diversity of languages as well.
    I also created a lab journal for reference of many science experiments.
    In the field of coding, I have created 6 games.
     4 of them are from the WhiteHatJr curriculum, which are online car racing,AngryBirds,Ping Pong and a T-rex runner game.
     The other 2 were solo projects created by me. They were Pac-Man and an Alien Space shooter game.
